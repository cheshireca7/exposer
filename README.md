# ExpüëÅÔ∏èser
exposer is a go tool supported by <a href="https://github.com/projectdiscovery/uncover">uncover</a> to perform query monitoring to different search engines, and storing results in Elasticsearch.

# Dependencies
exposer requires a running Elasticsearch cluster to work properly. Information required to establish communication should be specified in `config.yaml`, or `.env` if running exposer via **docker-compose**.

## Provider Configuration

Uncover requires API keys to the different search engiens to be used. Exposer will not run until one API key is specified at least.
The provider configuration file should be located at `$HOME/.config/uncover/provider-config.yaml`

```

```

# Install with docker
exposer has its own image that could be downloaded from Docker Hub

```sh
